Description:

This webpage is a brief overview of who I am, my current experience as a web developer, and methods of contact.

The header displays my name in the top left hand corner of the page, as well as three separate links for About, Projects, and Contact that lead to those sections in the webpage.

The section below is listed as "Full-Stack Web Developer".

The third section displays a background image as a way to enhance the webpage's display.

The About section describes my current experience as a web developer as well as my prior experience as a life insurance analyst.

The Projects section has the two assignments that we have worked on so far: The Code_Refactor homework and the Pre_work files assignments. The images are linked to the GitHub repositories associated with those projects.

The Contact section has three methods of contact: Phone Number, LinkedIn, and GitHub. The LinkedIn and GitHub sections are linked to my personal pages at each of those websites.
